# Download-File-Cleanup
This code sorts the download folder into several directories with all downloaded files currently within the downloads folder. 

#I couldn't get the first code to work so I made myself feel better with this simpler code. 

Make sure to replace "path_to_your_downloads_folder" with the actual path to your Downloads folder before running the script. Also, feel free to modify the folder_mapping dictionary to include additional file extensions and corresponding folder names as needed.
